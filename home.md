# Mollusks 4 Addison

### Happy 25th Birthday, Addison!!

I can't believe we've been quarantined for 5 months now - but hey, at least we're quarantined together.

Grateful for you and all the crazy times we've had together in these crazy times:
  * brandon4mollusks.com & mollusks4addison.com
  * our day trip to Yosemite
    ![yosemite](/yosemite.jpg)
  * this salt pond in Menlo Park
  * community..."I shall have...a BIRTHDAY CAKE!!"
  * matching as always
  * grilling...so much grilling
  
I know we said this last year...but next year can only be better than this one, right? To kick it off, I hope you enjoy your first taste of a mollusk-like echinoderm.

<3 Brandon
